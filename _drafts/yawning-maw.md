Sometimes when I see my children defying me or disobeying me or resisting my will, I see in those moments this deep fear of oblivion inside of me. That who I am is, in their resistance to me, being erased, that my will is being eradicated, that I am forgotten and disappearing, that everything that makes me me, that makes me exist is falling into this yawning maw. That their resistance to me will kill me. That if I allow them to continue in their rebellion, I will cease. And so I get angry to resist and to allow myself to continue to exist.

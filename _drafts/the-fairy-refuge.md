## Recap

When last we left our heroes,

Santa Clause, having defeated Gizzard the Lizard Wizard with a gifted Cloak of Poison, found a map to a fairy refuge in the nearby woods. Collecting some companions and travelling into the woods, they found the entrance hidden in a tree and lighting torches entered in. Making their way into the first room, they found yellow moss glowing on the ceiling and mushrooms, corn, and potates growing in the dark. They journeyed to the east into an sandy cavern with a cool stream running along the east. While searching the room a dank wind from the north along the stream blast through the room, extinguishing all their torches. After lighting new torches, they found some swords and spears mouldering along the western wall and then found a +2 sword of charm person and a divine scroll (purify food and drink, quest). As they picked these up, a six-winged fairy named Spring Blossom entered the room and agreed to give those items if they could drive off the intruders in her home: a pack of mountain lions, a swarm of flies, a room where the ceiling falls on you, and a room where the water attacks you. Wandering north they entered a library where the books flew off the shelves to rearrange themselves. One book smashed Luna the Half-dog in the dead, killing her. Listening at the 3 entrances to the room, they heard buzzing to the north and so assuming there was nothing useful in any of those books, they snuck to the north, only to be attacked by flies. Upon swiftly dispatching the first one, the rest fled in terror. While searching the room, our heroes found a clutch of fly eggs and burned them. Nothing else of interest was present in the forge room. Upon looking in the hall to the north, they saw a room of statues with paintings on the walls and a mural of the sky from sunrise to sunset on the ceiling. Our heroes noticed a strange grouping of 14 stalactites on the ceiling. Assuming these were piercers, an assumption that proved accurate, our heroes began trying to get the piercers off the ceiling and kill them. A swift battle ensued and Dimitrios the Beast Master was killed by a falling piercer. Santa Clause was also pierced by one and brought to a hair's breath from death, our party disengaged from the battle and attempted to strategize.

beclad in iron, or the lay of castorel/cassiel

he came alone, beclad in iron
unbidden to that hall of feasting.
the precision in his step belied
a calm unbidden lethality
yet his mien was bright, clear-eyed he stood
afore the king, robed in crimson bright.
the king sat silent, waiting, quiet,
hoping for words he knew would ne'er come.
that dreadful silence, heavy, looming,
filled that chamber with dread foreboding.

iron-beclad he spoke out clearly,
eyes forever fixéd on that king,
the words he spoke were ne'er forgotten:
"alas my king, this is a fell day.
ere were i suckled thou took from me
that dearest woman who gavest life.
my mother died on that dreadful day
when smote thee down my lord, my father.
she could not bear this life bereft of
he whom she most lovest best and
he who lovéd her beyond his death.
    ? he who loved her past untimely death

"it is clear she was wronged by your hand.
ne'er shall i rest until i see
her sweetest poured out life blood avenged.
though i am but this morn knighted, yet
God shall ever judge my cause right just.
a pox on thee most fell-heartéd king,
if for some foul reason you deny
my right to swift trial by combat.
swine, there is yet time to eat thine fill,
and quickly meet on that battle field."

"nay, nay," sir calegrenant bolt upright,
"desist these foul curses gainst our fair king.
know thee not that every idle curse
rings back upon the head who swears it?
perchance thine father died in battle,
is this just cause to curse him in deed?
or think ye that our king now unjust
to have slain he who opposed him which
pulled that sword from blackened stone, thereby
showing himself as rightwise born king?"

"i see thee art a coward, sir knight
who will not meet after meal to fight.
what reason have thee to defer
when just before you spit in mine eye?"

"is it not that great feast whitsuntide?
and thee would spill mine blood beside. no,
today is not the day for quarrels.
tomorrow justice will see thed die."

"fah, have not we all heard mass this morn?
i will spill thine blood this holy day.
out. rise. meet me in the lists ere i
lose my temper and act too rashly."

that good sir calgrenant bowed his head.
gently crossed himself and thus he said
"let God judge between us, this quarrel
shall soon be ended. by thine gracious
leave most upright king, give me this quest."

in sadness that good king looked upon
that young boy, that young knight in iron
for he loved him well and wished no harm
but was there possibly some strange way
by which bloodshed might be avoided?

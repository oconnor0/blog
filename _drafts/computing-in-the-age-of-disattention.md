It has come to my attention that there is a deep sickness pervasive throughout our Western world these days.
We have traded our sharp attention for a disaffected disattention without quite realizing what has happened to us.
Perhaps we chose this path and perhaps it was chosen for us, but nonetheless we find ourselves unable to attend.

As Ivan Illich observes, "silence is necessary for the emergence of persons".
Yet everywhere we look there is no silence but an urgent need to never be bored, never be silent, never allow silence to exist around us or in our heads.

If you have ever spent time in silence with just youir thoughts, it is perhaps obvious why it is so greatly fears.
The demons lurking in our heart come climbing out all too quickly to tempt us in ways we wish were not so alluring.
And so we have filled every space around us with such noise and distraction that those lurking fiends need not trouble us.
We have troubled ourselves enough for a hundred lifetimes.

But what is disattention?
And how do computers relate to it?

To *attend* is to bring the faculties of my personhood to bear on that which is at hand.
It is to be most fully human because all that I am is present on what is before me.

To *inattend*, or rather my *inattention*, is to ignore that which is presently unnecessary or distracting.
This is sometimes necessary to properly attend to something, but must be carefully regulated through proper attention.

The act of *disattention* is to continually shatter my attention across time, space, experiences, desires, thoughts, and sensation in an attempt to always feel something.

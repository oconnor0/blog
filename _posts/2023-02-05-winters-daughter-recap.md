## Recap

Our four intrepid adventurers were hired by Gizzard the Lizard Wizard to retrieve a bronze ring set with a moonstone held by fittings in the form of woven branches.
They made their way into the Dolmenwood and found this tomb, now surrounded by the woods, having long ago been abandonded.
As they approached, a ring of standing stones marked the entrace path to the burial mound.
They slowed investigating the standing stones, the iron owls clinking between them, and the skeleton of a stag dripping a green haze from it.
After walking around the mound and noticing a tunnel burrowed into the mound with a green slime trail leading from it, they decided to attempt to break open the stone slab covering the entrance.
As Gandalf began smashing the stone slab open with hammer and chisel, he became transfixed for an hour upon seeing a violet-eyed, ghostly owl.
Undeterred, he opened the way into the tomb and led them down.

After walking down into the tomb, the adventurers collected 4 religious items set in pedestals around the room: a silver holy symbol, a wooden statue of a cherub, a holy book, and a huge candle.
They noticed a mural hidden underneath the dust, cleared it off, and were able to read the Old Woldish inscription that says "Here lies the noble Sir Chyde, slayer of Frost, defender of the King."
Seeing a stone door in front of them, they decided to walk to the west, finding a marble statue of a fair maiden, begging silence, blindfolded, and staring - if that were possible - down a set of unusually pristine stairs that showed the reflected light of water.
Continuing north, they found themselves in a small chapel with a small statue of St Sedge holding a red candle set upon a stone altar.
After poking around, Gandalf decided to remove the tapestry from the western wall and found a locked swollen door behind it.

The group broke through the door and were surprised by a pair of wormtongues - squirming, tongue-like worms with tooth-ringed mouths.
Gandalf used the tapestry he had collected from the wall to wipe off acid left by a wormtongue bite, saving his life and destroying the tapestry in the process.
Working together, they made short work of the wormtongues and proceeded to investigate the room.
Inside the desk, they found a brass sheet engraved with the name of one of Sir Chyde's favored hunting dogs: Flaegr.
Underneath a flagstone in the floor, Pink Lile opened a locked box and found: a silver holy symbol, a prayer book of stamped gold leaf, a scroll of hold person, and a box of 20 holy wafers.
Upon eating a wafer, Gandalf discovered that they restored a little life.

The party returned to the chapel and continued north, finding a pair of gigantic stone dogs chained to a pair of stone doors.
Upon the doors is written: "Call to the Companions".
They continued through a passage to the east and came into a room of 7 stone statues holding weapons: flanged mace, morningstar, battle axe, warhammer, longsword, halberd, spear, and a +2 longsword (that compels wielder to attack largest foe in battle).
Santa Clause investigated the yellow and purple mold covered room and uncovered parts of a mural that showed the longsword in the room to be Sir Chyde's and revealed the name of his other hunting dog to be Grondr.
Continuing south, they found another round room with a mirror set on its stone pedestal and a set of pristine stairs leading down to water.
As Pip walked to look through the room to verify that the entrance on the west of the room would indeed take them back to the tomb entrance, she found herself transfixed in place, paralyzed.
Gandalf and Santa Clause grabbed the mirror from the side, turned it upside down, and carried it out setting it on the ground.
With Pink Lile's help, they carried Pip outside and after a minute or so, she regained control of her limbs.

Heading back into the tomb, they walked their way toward the stone dogs, fighting off another pair of wormtongues, and spoke the names: Flaegr and Grondr.
The doors opened.
In front of them they saw a round room with a stone coffer inside on the floor and an azure ghost kneeling before a portrait of a woman.
The ghost, displeased with them for clearly carrying the weapons from his tomb, asked why they were there.
Pink Lile explained, "We're 'venturers. A lizard wizard sent us to get the ring!"
After some tense negotiations, including the ghost of Sir Chyde choosing not to attack them when they asked what would happen if they destroyed the ring, they agreed to take his ring to the princess down the stairs.
Though tempted by the bracelets on Sir Chyde's skeleton, they took only the ring and went down the stairs through candles floating in midair and into Fairy.
Seeing a purple void dripping from the sky onto the ground and a second set of candles floating to their west, they verified that those candles would indeed take them back to the tomb.

Walking to the tower in front of them, across the frozen lake, the entered and found a goblin sitting atop a troll checking off the guest list to a royal wedding.
Though they could not convince the goblin they were on the invite list, Pink Lile, Santa Clause, and Gandalf ate a mushroom from the goblin's pouch that they might enter.
Santa Clause began wretching maggots and worms, Gandalf began alternatively weeping and laughing hysterically, and Pink Lile turned translucent.
Stymied by the doorkeep, Pip took Pink Lile aside, gave her the ring, and sent her off in search of the princess.
Pink Lile walked up the stairs and through the banquet hall unmolested until she found Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk preparing for her wedding in the top floor.
She walked up to the princess who asked for the ring.
Pink Lile said, "I have it here!" and gave it to her.

The princess placed the ring on the finger, greeted Sir Chyde, and offered Pink Lile either jewels from from jewelbox or a wish.
Pink Lile wished for a golden plate with 4 cookies.
The princess then asked for help escaping from this tower where she is imprisoned.
Pink Lile went downstairs and each of them ate 1 cookie.
Their hearts will ever long for Fairy.

Our heroes then left the tower, returned through the floating candles to the tomb, collected the bracelets on Sir Chyde's skeleton, the painting of Princess Snowfall-at-Dusk, and the 4 silver candlestands in his tomb, and left the tomb.
As they walked out of the tomb, the mirror they had left on the grass was gone; two days having passed while in Fairy.
They returned to Lankshorn, sold off their treasures, and then Santa Clause went to visit Gizzard.
Gizzard asked him where his ring that he had hired them to collect was.
Santa Clause then attempted to attack Gizzard who put him to sleep, took all of his gold, and left him outside his door with a note pinned to his chest.
"Next time come back with my ring. - G"

The group collected 6500 GP in treasure, split 4 ways is 1625 GP each.
The group earned 9694 in experience, split 4 ways is 2424 XP each.
